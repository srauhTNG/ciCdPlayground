# The playground - Adjusted for testing
This is intended to be a minimal project for a CI/CD workshop.
It consists of a simple JavaScript project, some unit and integration tests, and example configuration for some CI/CD tools.

## Setup
Yarn is recommended, but corresponding npm commands should work, too.

To install dependencies run `yarn`

Serve at localhost:8081 with `yarn dev`

Run tests with `yarn test` and `yarn test:e2e`

## Provisioning
In the workshop infrastructure we provision an S3 bucket 'cicd-workshop-playground' 
and give the Jenkins instance write access to it. 
Thus, the s3Upload plugin for Jenkins can deploy to the bucket.
After running Jenkinsfile_deploy the app is accessible at 
https://cicd-workshop-playground.s3.amazonaws.com/$GITHUB_USERNAME/index.html

Here is some [nushell](www.nushell.sh) magic to open all deployed instances of the artefact:
```
http get https://cicd-workshop-playground.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com | get content.content | flatten | where tag == Key | get content | flatten | get content | split column '/' | get column1 | uniq | each {|username| $"https://cicd-workshop-playground.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/($username)/index.html"} | each {|url| ^open $url}

```
`open` is the macOS CLI command to open a URL, on Linux replace it with the command for the browse you want to use. (You don't need the `^` if the command does not collide with a nushell build-in.) 

# The tools
## Github Actions
Running out of the box on, well, Github, see `.github`.
## Jenkins (WIP)
There is a Jenkinsfile present. 
Current status has to be checked.
## Gitlab CI
There is a `.gitlab-ci.yml` with working test stages. Deployment has to be checked.
## TeamCity (POC)
Requires a TeamCity server, e.g. https://hub.docker.com/r/jetbrains/teamcity-server.
Due to issues with TeamCity's docker wrapper in some dockerised agents, an agent with locally installed yarn is required. 
The way TeamCity handles its docker containers make a docker in docker setup rather complicated, 
so that support for this rather obscure CI/CD tool is probably not worth the effort.
See `.teamcity` for a basic setup.
